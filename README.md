# Advent of Code 2024

This year, I'm attempting the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) with [⚡️Zig](https://ziglang.org/). I normally don't use low-level languages on my day-to-day, so I take this opportunity to jump out of my comfort zone.

I'll also do it all in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (btw), which I'm currently learning. I'm a serial vim dropout, but I think this time is the one.

I do not intend to complete it, I never do. Life gets in the way. But I always have a lot of fun for the first few days!

Happy hacking ✌️
